- delete key ?
- rotate key ?
  - Mark key in keyring as replaced with ref of new key
  - Refuse to decrypt key encrypted with rotated key unless operation is rotate
  - Rotate command will:
    - Decrypt values encrypted with rotated key
    - Store decrypted values in map with (old) encrypted value as key
    - Encrypt values in map
    - Do string replace for each (search with key, replace with value)
